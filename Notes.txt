Instructions to get Sparta to work
Error: Import Failed. Elixir library not found.
Try installing it with: apt install python-elixer

Temporary Fix

Download from github
	git clone https://github.com/secforce/sparta.git
	
On Terminal
	#This will allow you to view the branches
	git branch -a
	* Master
		remotes/origin/HEAD
		remotes/origin/dev
		remotes/origin/master
	# Switch branches with checkout
	git checkout -b dev remotes/origin/dev
	
Move the sparta file to /usr/bin
*Make sure that it is executable*

Type sparta in terminal to confirm.
Make sure sqlalchemy is up to date
pip3 install --upgrade sqlalchemy
